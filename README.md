U.hs
=============

U.hs is a weakly typed pure functional lazy evaluating toy language based on untyped lambda calculus. It features a very simply type system (which borrows from [Unlambda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlambda)):
```
function :: function -> function
```
Hence, there is essentially no type at all, so any program type-checks. However, important modifications are made to make the language marginally useful:

1. Lambda is introduced back, for the sake of any sane soul. A Lisp-style syntax is used for function application.
2. Built-in callback-based IO mechanism to let the program say hello world. Also, there are built-in numeric values.
3. Module system, standard library and syntax sugar.

The purpose of U.hs is to let those annoyed by Haskell's type system get a look and feel of how life is like without it. You can use the power of untyped lambda calculus to (re-)invent:

* Pairs, bools, lists and various fundamental data types
* ADT, pattern matching, guard statement
* Monadic programming

And along the way, you will begin to appreciate how good the world was.

Getting Started
----------------

U.hs uses file extension .u. Example of aplusb.u:
```
(import* io)
(import* str)
(run
	(line readLine)
	(let s (sum (map atoi (splitStr ' ' (rstrip line)))))
	(_ (putStrLn (itoa s)))
	(exit 0)
)
```
The "run" statement is syntax sugar for chaining callbacks: (run (a b) (c d) e) = (b (\\a (d (\\c e)))). 

To interpretively run the program call urun
```
$ghc urun.hs
$./urun aplusb.u
1 2
3
```

urun is also an REPL interpreter
```
$./urun
; type :q to quit, :? for help
prelude>(+ 3 1)
4
prelude>(import* io)
prelude io>(putStrLn "ha" print)
ha
0
>:q
```
Note that, "print" is just the identity function (\\x x).

There is also a way to compile .u source code to binary:
```
$ghc ucomp.hs
$./ucomp aplusb.u
$./aplusb
1 2
3 
```

Language Specification
----------------
There is a (Chinese) tutorial called "report.pdf" in report/report.pdf.

More documentation will be written when the language reaches a relatively stable state.

To have some fun, you can look at parseu.u (and uglyprinter.u) which are translations of the UParse.hs source code, the parser of U.hs language. And try to think of what other fun you can have with it!
